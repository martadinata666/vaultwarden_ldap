# vaultwarden_ldap
An LDAP connector for [vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden)

After configuring, run `vaultwarden_ldap` and it will invite any users it finds in LDAP to your `vaultwarden` instance.

## Deploying

This is easiest done using Docker. See the `docker-compose.yml` file in this repo for an example. If you would like to use Docker Hub rather than building, change `build: .` to `image: vividboarder/vaultwarden_ldap`.

Make sure to populate and mount your `config.toml`!

## Configuration

Configuration is read from a TOML file. The default location is `config.toml`, but this can be configured by setting the `CONFIG_PATH` env variable to whatever path you would like.

Configuration values are as follows:

|Name|Type|Optional|Description|
|----|----|--------|-----------|
|`vaultwarden_url`|String||The root URL for accessing `vaultwarden`. Eg: `https://vw.example.com`|
|`vaultwarden_admin_token`|String||The value passed as `ADMIN_TOKEN` to `vaultwarden`|
|`vaultwarden_root_cert_file`|String|Optional|Path to an additional der-encoded root certificate to trust. Eg. `root.cert`. If using Docker see `docker-compose.yml` for how to expose it. Defaults to `empty`|
|`ldap_host`|String||The hostname or IP address for your ldap server|
|`ldap_scheme`|String|Optional|The that should be used to connect. `ldap` or `ldaps`. This is set by default based on SSL settings|
|`ldap_ssl`|Boolean|Optional|Indicates if SSL should be used and if we should connect with `ldaps`. Defaults to `false`|
|`ldap_starttls`|Boolean|Optional|Indicates if the connection should be done using StartTLS|
|`ldap_no_tls_verify`|Boolean|Optional|Indicates if certificate should be verified when using SSL. Defaults to `true`|
|`ldap_port`|Integer|Optional|Port used to connect to the LDAP server. This will default to 389 or 636, depending on your SSL settings|
|`ldap_bind_dn`|String||The dn for the bind user that will connect to LDAP. Eg. `cn=admin,dc=example,dc=org`|
|`ldap_bind_password`|String||The password for the provided bind user.|
|`ldap_search_base_dn`|String||Base dn that will be used when searching LDAP for users. Eg. `dc=example,dc=org`|
|`ldap_search_filter`|String||Filter used when searching LDAP for users. Eg. `(&(objectClass=*)(uid=*))`|
|`ldap_mail_field`|String|Optional|Field for each user record that contains the email address to use. Defaults to `mail`|
|`ldap_sync_interval_seconds`|Integer|Optional|Number of seconds to wait between each LDAP request. Defaults to `60`|
|`ldap_sync_loop`|Boolean|Optional|Indicates whether or not syncing should be polled in a loop or done once. Defaults to `true`|

Alternatively, instead of using `config.toml`, all values can be provided using enviroment variables prefixed with `APP_`. For example: `APP_VAULTWARDEN_URL=https://vault.example.com`

## Development

This repo has a predefined set of [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) rules. You can install pre-commit via any means you'd like. Once your system has `pre-commit` installed, you can run `make install-hooks` to ensure the hooks will run with every commit. You can also force running all hooks with `make check`.

For those less familiar with `cargo`, you can use the `make` targets that have been included for common tasks like running a debug version. `make run-debug` or building a release version `make release`.

## Testing

There are no unit tests, but there are integration tests that require manual verification.

### Integration tests

Running `make itest` will spin up an ldap server with a test user, a Vaultwarden server, and then run the sync. If successful the log should show an invitation sent to the test user. If you run `make itest` again, it should show no invites sent because the user already has been invited. If you'd like to reset the testing, `make clean-itest` will clear out the Vaultwarden database and start fresh.

It's also possible to test passing configs via enviornment variables by running `make itest-env`. The validation steps are the same.


### Steps for manual testing

The first step is to set up Bitwarden and the LDAP server.

```bash
docker-compose up -d vaultwarden ldap ldap_admin
```

1. After that, open the admin portal on http://localhost:8001 and log in using the default account info:

    Username: cn=admin,dc=example,dc=org
    Password: admin

From there you can set up your test group and users.

2. Expand the `dc=example,dc=org` nav tree and select "Create new entry here"
3. Select "Generic: Posix Group"
4. Give it a name, eg. "Users" and then save and commit
5. Select "Create child object"
6. Select "Generic: User Account"
7. Give the user a name and select a group ID number and save and commit
8. Select "Add new attribute" and select "Email" and then add a test email address

9. Run the ldap sync

```bash
docker-compose up ldap_sync
```

Alternately, you can bootstrap some of this by running:

    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f itest/docker-compose.itest.yml up --build
